Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The goal for this assignment was to create code to enable my board to do morse code and OK. It was also programmed with an interrupt where pressing a button will interrupt which side you press.

What did you do particularly well?
It took some work to get the code to work correctly.

Where could you improve?
I still need to work on my coding skills in general.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
more knowledge on the C++ language and knowledge of embedded systems.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I will have more practice on coding for the next project.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Proper commenting is always important when coding to make it maintainable, readable, and adaptable for you and anybody else who may work on your code.
